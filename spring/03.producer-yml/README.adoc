= Configured producer

This example shows you the possibility to customize the producer functionality Spring for Kafka using configuration only. The code does not change from previous example - we are only customizing the producer using application.{properties|yaml}

Inspect `src/main/application.yml`.

Whole `spring.kafka.*` configuration tree is being backed up by `org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.kafka.KafkaProperties` class which you can analyze for possible options to set.

Some portion of configuration will be common for all clients (producer, consumer, admin, streams). Some is only for some particular client type.
