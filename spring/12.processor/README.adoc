= Processor

Up until now we were inspecting examples of data being either produced (the beginning of the processing pipeline) or consumed (the terminal, last operation of processing).

We now introduce a processor pattern:

* Processor is a consumer - it reads data from a topic
* Processor is processing data somehow - transforming it or invoking side actions
* Processor is a producer - the result of processing is published as a new message to a new topic.

Inspect `com.luxoft.lmd.kafka.DataProcessor`:

* @KafkaListener annotated method returns a result now instead of void.

* This result will be automatically directed to a new topic. We use a new `@SendTo` annotation to specify the destination.

* This processor is transactional. In case the processing fails the input message will be re-read from the topic and processing will be repeated so we do not loose that event.
