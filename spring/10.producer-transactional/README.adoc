= Transactional producer

To enable transactional message sending to Kafka perform following steps:

* define `spring.kafka.producer.transaction-id-prefix` in application.{properties|yaml}

* Annotate the sending method with `@org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional` annotation.

* Spring will:

** Automatically detect this configuration for you

** create a `KafkaTransactionManager`

** manage transaction for you for annotated methods.

WARNING: Remember there is no way for Kafka transactions to participate in relational database transactions. There is no XA (distributed transactions) support.
