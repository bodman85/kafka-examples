= Concurrency

A topic has to be created partition count number > 0 to allow multiple consumers consuming in parallel.

You can run this application multiple times in your IDE. Watch the logs to find out how partitions have been assigned to each consumer.

You can also run multiple consumers in just one app. Spring for Kafka will spin up multiple consumers on multiple threads.

* `com.luxoft.lmd.kafka.DataListener` listener sleeps for 1 second. That emulates long processing time.

* At the same time the messages are produced in a rate of 2 messages/s - data is produced faster than we can consume it.

* Use Kafka web UI (i.e. AKHQ) to find out what current consumer group lag is. Notice that it is growing all the time - our system cannot process data fast enough.

* Enable concurrency at the level of `@KafkaListener` - find the proper setting to mitigate slow processing and get the consumer lag value close to 0 and NOT GROWING.
