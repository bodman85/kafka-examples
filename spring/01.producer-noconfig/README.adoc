= Simplest producer

This is the simplest producer using Spring for Kafka integration.

Inspect `com.luxoft.lmd.kafka.AppRunner` for actual code.


Make sure you notice:

* no configuration provided in application.{properties|yaml}
+
Spring assumes that local Kafka cluster listens on `localhost:9092` without credentials required.

* We use an injected `KafkaTemplate` - we did not create that bean. Spring Boot starter pack did it for us.

* You do not have to create the `ProducerRecord` you know from Kafka Java Client API - `KafkaTemplate` has multiple variants of `send()` method to simplify message sending.
